iPadOS app, specifically made for the iPad Pro 12,9 inch (2022)

Technologies/techniques used:

- MVVM-Delegate architecture pattern
- Core Data
- Closures
- Programmatic UIKit
- Websockets
- Codeable
- Database normalisation using the cogNIAM method
- polymorphically defined UI-components
- multithreading
- conditional compilation directives

This app was part of a wider interdisciplinary project for realising a mechatronic solar panel that could be controlled and have information read from it with an iPadOS app,
with a Debian-based Node-Red server as intermediary. The iPadOS app was made by me, the Node-Red flow was made by my teacher, and the Arduino hardware + codes were made
together with three other team members.
