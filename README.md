Technologies/techniques used:

This app was part of a wider interdisciplinary project for realising a mechatronic solar panel that could be controlled and have information read from it with an iPadOS app,
with a Debian-based Node-Red server as intermediary. The iPadOS app was made by me, the Node-Red flow was made by my teacher, and the Arduino hardware + codes were made
together with three other team members.
